        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (10 ounces) unsalted butter, cubed and chilled</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons shortening, cubed</li>
        <li> 2/3 cup ice water, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 strips bacon </li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream or half-and-half
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>  1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Gruyère cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
        
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <h3>Make the crust</h3>
   <ol type="i"></ol> <li>
Whisk flour with salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingertips, blend in butter and shortening until they resemble small peas. Sprinkle water on top and mix until dough begins to come together; add another tablespoon or 2 of ice water as needed. Turn dough out onto a work surface and gently knead 2 or 3 times, just until it comes together. Divide dough in half and pat each half into a 1-inch-thick disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
</li><li> 
Roll out dough on a lightly floured work surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 11-inch round about 1/8 inch thick. Ease dough into an 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim overhang so it is flush with rim of tart pan. Refrigerate crust until firm, about 30 minutes.
</li><li> 
Preheat oven to 450°F. Line tart shell with aluminum foil and fill to top with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until crust is set, about 10 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake shell for about 8 minutes longer, until crust is golden and crisp. Transfer crust to a rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F.
</li>
<h3>Make the filling</h3> <li>
Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel–lined plate to drain. Crumble bacon into pieces.
</li><li> 
Whisk eggs with heavy cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until well blended. Scatter half of the cheese in an even layer on bottom of crust and top with bacon. Pour custard on top, then top with remaining cheese. Bake quiche on middle rack of oven until custard is set and quiche is nicely browned on top, about 35 minutes. Transfer quiche to a rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Unmold quiche and serve.
